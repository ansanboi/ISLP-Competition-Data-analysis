# ISLP-Competition-Data-analysis
The code for our team's entry to the ISLP poster competition.
This is the collaboration between myself and my colleague Petru Codrescu at the University of Toronto. The jupyter notebook files contain our proposed analysis of the data gathered by the Canadian Social Connection Survey and two different approaches. One, a logistic regression prediction model and two, a binary classification tree model.
